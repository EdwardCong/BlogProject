# BlogProject

This project was created with a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn). I am also following 
a tutorial to connect to mongodb by Ado Kukic (https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/nextjs-with-mongodb/).

I am combining these tutorials to create a personal blog and showcase projects. I am going to add in custom API routes and TypeScript.
